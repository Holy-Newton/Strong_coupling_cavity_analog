Classical Analog Model of Light—Matter Strong Coupling in an Optical Cavity:

To explain the formation of the Rabi splitting in the spectrum of a strong coupling cavity, we use a classical analog model to
demonstrate that in this conditions the proprieties of matter are modify. We demonstrate the formation of two polaritonic
states, the conditions for there creations, and the influence of the di↵erent parameters on the evolution, numerically and with
an analytical approximation.
